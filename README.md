<h3>Welcome! <b>DiscordRC</b> is a simple tool that allows you to remotely control Windows-based computers/servers with a Discord bot on any platform.</h3>
* As of right now I do not plan on adding support to control any platforms other than Windows.

# <b>Coming Soon</b>
I have had the idea to make this project for a while now; I finally started working on it after I suggested the idea to my friend in which he loved it. I have always wanted to control my servers from different devices easily. Now I can, I just need to login to Discord on any platform and I am in!

DiscordRC is currently in its prototype phase; <b>I would NOT recommend using it in an actual project.</b>
